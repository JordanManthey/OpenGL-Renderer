# OpenGL-Renderer
I'm Building a 3D graphics renderer from the ground-up using minimal 3rd-party libraries. This currently supports dynamic batch rendering, importing .gltf 3D models, and diffuse/specular lighting. I will continue to update this project in my quest to learn more about graphics programming.
